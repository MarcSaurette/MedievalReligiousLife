# Exercise no. 3

## Document Significance

_1250 words of revised text + 750 new words_

{% hint style="info" %}
The rewritten document analysis should incorporate the feedback offered by your  professor as well as demonstrate further research. Your rewritten document analysis should also further demonstrate your familiarity with key secondary sources on the topic you are writing.&#x20;

In the time between submitting ex. 2 and ex. 3, you should do more reading about your topic, so that when it comes time to complete your project, you will have more knowledge about the context of the document and perhaps about how historians have understood its significance. Your reading might in fact change how you view the document, and thus might require you to alter your interpretation of the evidence it offers.
{% endhint %}

This exercise picks up where your last one ended - the areas of interest that you identified. In this project you should choose one of those areas and focus your discussion around it. If you were interested in thinking further about your document's presentation of gender, for example, you don't need to talk about kingship (unless it was directly relevent to making your larger point about gender). It is not sufficient however to have simply an area to talk about. You need to organize your discussion of your topic into an argument.&#x20;

* If you were reading the _Life of Catherine of Siena_ you might wish to argue that she the life portrays her service to God as a means to have liberty from patriarchal society and is able to escape normal gender roles for a woman of her station by taking the habit. Or maybe you want to think about her gendered experience of emotion? Or maybe you were really disgusted when you read the part of her saint's life where she was licking the pus of the oozing wounds of a patient she was caring for and you really need to understand why it was included in her saint's life...
* If you're addressing the portrayals of Muslims in the _Estoria de España_, and maybe you want to focus only on the fascination with their many wives and how it is used to Other them.&#x20;

In sum, your goal is to not just describe but to argue something: You should:

1. Reflect on the purpose of the primary source: a document’s form and purpose affects the material it contains. Why was this source written? What was the historical context in which the source was produced? How does its form affect its content?
2. Consider how the author, audience, and purpose affect the reliability of this document as primary source? For example, did the author know enough to make accurate assessments in his observations firsthand or was he drawing on established traditions? Does the author have reasons for excluding or misrepresenting information to the intended audience?

This stage of the project tests your ability to communicate effectively, and in order to do so, your writing must make clear the direction of your paper from the outset - which is something we call a thesis statement. A thesis statement should never revolve around value judgements (i.e. whether something is the best, the most important, or someone is great, important…). Rather, a thesis statement is a one or two sentence condensation of the argument to follow. A good thesis statement will:

1. address a subject about which people could reasonably disagree
2. deal with a subject that can be adequately treated given the nature and expectations of the assignment (i.e. not too big, able to be addressed with your secondary source)
3. express one main idea you are tackling. Be specific.
4. assert your conclusion about the subject.

### Project Contents

**Introduction.** This should now include a clearly-worded thesis statement about your proposed area of inquiry and your particular take.&#x20;

**Body of the Paper**

In previous exercises, I specified the specific organization of the paper. You can continue to use this structure or rework it entirely at this point. Once you have a clear argument, the more open ended description of author, context and content of the past exercises can be more made to be more focussed - eliminating irrelevant material that does not pertain to the specific point being argued.&#x20;

The final stage of your previous exercise was to identify general themes and potential areas of interest. In this exercise (no. 3) those section should be eliminated as in this version, you should only have one area of interest - your thesis. As well, when you talked about authorshop of the document, you may have included many details about the author that now you can address in a more condensed fashion to suit your more delimited topic.

A clear obvious structure is one of the most important attributes of this exercise. Limit yourself to one main idea per paragraph and have each paragraph build logically towards a supported thesis. The structure of the paper should be based in the construction of analytic categories. Try to avoid a general grouping-together of seemingly related ideas; instead you should have an explicit and logical structure. The paper should also avoid only describing your source chronologically or linearly, since that organization typifies description, but does not promote analysis.

(NEW)  **Argumentation.** In this new section, you should marshal evidence to argue your thesis. Show the reader (don't just tell them) how the source leads you to make a conclusion about the topic you are addressing.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to be historically correct. You are being asked to make an argument based on a very small sample size. You will not be assessed whether your argument is correct (as historians now see it), but rather simply on whether you are able to logically argue your case.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Quotations.** Quotations cannot be placed within your text as an independent unit. They must be introduced (even if only as, “X makes point A clear when he says…”). This introduction allows your writing to point to how you are taking the quotation (i.e. negative or positively) and to give it a sense of context. Do not introduce a direct quotation as if indirect speech (i.e. do not use, “he says that” unless you are paraphrasing). Quotations of less than three lines should be included in the text, prefixed by a comma. An example would be the following: Marc says, “Introduce your quotations with a comma and surround them with quotation marks.” But if the quotation is longer than three lines, it would take the following form:

In seeking to provide a clear example of what he means, Marc writes:

> It is key for the understanding of quotations that they be introduced properly, thus giving a sense of who is speaking, what is being argued and how the quotation relates to what is being said in your paper. It is important, moreover, to set off large quotations (1/2 inch indent on both sides) within the body of your text. There is no need for quotation marks in this situation.

Your project needs to be explicit about how your quotations demonstrate your specific point. The meaning that you wish to demonstrate with the quotation is not necessarily self evident to the reader and must be made clear within your discussion.

**Conclusion**. You paper should provide a crisp conclusion. No wishy-washy, sentimental or moral judgements please (e.g. Alfonso VI was a great emperor!) that reproduce the bias of the primary source. Instead seek to explain the document as a work of rhetoric (e.g. the _Estoria de España_ contrasts Alfonso and al-Qadir to show good rulers were X and Y...). A conclusion should briefly recall to the reader the highlights of your analysis and might introduce a new problem or idea raised by your analysis (e.g. if you were to keep studying this source what more would you like to explore/research).&#x20;

**Cite sources.** When you make a claim that is not supported by evidence from the document, you need to cite a reasonably-academic secondary source to buttress it. These sources need to be cited carefully. Footnotes are the standard citation method for history papers. The document must be cited fully in a footnote the first time it is referenced. Subsequent citations may take the form of parenthetical notes which identify the page or line number (whichever is pertinent). Any other referenced source (monographs, textbook) should be cited using footnotes.

### Assessment of the final version

Your grade will be assessed on the quality of:

1. **Analysis**. The quality and depth of your historical analysis, your presentation of the historical issues confronted in the project and your understanding of the context in which the document was written.&#x20;
2. **Progression**. The development of your argument in a logical fashion, the presentation of your evidence in a clear, direct manner which can be easily followed by the reader.&#x20;
3. **Grammar and style**. The use of grammatically correct English, the use of consistent and suitably academic style throughout (including proper spelling, footnoting and bibliography).
