The rewritten document analysis should incorporate the feedback offered by your  professor as well as demonstrate further research. Your rewritten document analysis should also further demonstrate your familiarity with key secondary sources on the topic you are writing.&#x20;

In the time between submitting ex. 2 and ex. 3, you should do more reading about your topic, so that when it comes time to complete your project, you will have more knowledge about the context of the document and perhaps about how historians have understood its significance. Your reading might in fact change how you view the document, and thus might require you to alter your interpretation of the evidence it offers.

1. Reflect on the purpose of the primary source: A document’s form and purpose affects the material it contains. Why was this source written? What was the historical context in which the source was produced? What form of document is this (Legal? Opinion? Personal Letters?)? How does its form affect its content?
2. How do author, audience, and purpose affect the reliability of this document as primary source? For example, was the author know enough to make accurate assessments in his observations firsthand or was he drawing on established traditions? Does the author have reasons for excluding or misrepresenting information to the intended audience? How does the form (i.e. type) of document affect its reliability as a historical source?&#x20;



**Conclusion**. You paper should provide a crisp conclusion. No wishy-washy, sentimental or moral judgements please (e.g. Alfonso VI was a great emperor!) that reproduce the bias of the primary source - but seek to explain the document as a work of rhetoric (e.g. the _Estoria de España_ contrasts Alfonso and al-Qadir to show good rulers were ...). A conclusion should briefly recall to the reader the highlights of your analysis and might introduce a new problem or idea raised by your analysis.

**Cite sources.** When you make a claim that is not supported by evidence from the document, you need to cite a reasonably-academic secondary source to buttress it. These sources need to be cited carefully. Footnotes are the standard citation method for history papers. The document must be cited fully in a footnote the first time it is referenced. Subsequent citations may take the form of parenthetical notes which identify the page or line number (whichever is pertinent). Any other referenced source (monographs, textbook) should be cited using footnotes.
