# Exercise no. 1

## What is a Document Analysis paper about?

The ability to read historical documents with a discerning and critical eye is the foundation of the historian’s craft. The three exercises ask students to read and comment on one single document for all three chosen from the assigned readings in order to demonstrate and discuss the historical value of the source selected, that is, what you as a historian can learn about some aspect of medieval religion.

Documents rarely “tell their own story”. They require analysis and interpretation by historians – this is your job. Since every document is different and also sheds light on a variety of matters, it will be necessary for you to select one topic that can be reasonably discussed given your text. In the exercises, you will describe accurately the information contained in the document and what can be learned from it. Your paper should not simply paraphrase or retell the source text(s), but must organize a selection of material into an argument.

## What is a document?

A document is a type of primary source. A primary source is anything which can be considered evidence for a particular period of history and can include written texts, oral testimony, musical notation and lyrics, paintings, architecture, or material remains such as tools, furniture and dress. Most historians largely rely on written sources, called documents.

As primary sources, documents need to be distinguished from others sources, such as a _textbook_ (a book written by a professional scholar for students) and advanced research texts called _monographs_ (a book written by a professional scholar for other academic researchers and upper-level students of history), or _articles_ published by professional scholars in research publications (periodicals, journals). In general, secondary sources rely on the selection, interpretation and analysis of primary sources to make an argument about the past. Bear in mind that no single document can ever render a complete account of the past – usually historians use many different sources, and different kinds of sources to make their argument stronger.

## Exercise no. 1 -  Fundamentals&#x20;

_500 words minimum_

The first stage of your three-part document analysis project is to identify and communicate the fundamental information about your document.&#x20;

Your goal is to identity the **who** (the author, the audience\[s]), the **when** (when it was written, the time period it describes), and the **where** (where it was written, where it circulated).  In exercise no. 2 you will describe the **what** (what is it about) and in exercise no. 3 you will explain the **why** (why it was written in the way it was written) to explain what we, as historians, can see it offers evidence of.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Answering these questions will start usually from the introduction to your text. Source readers have concise introductions which provide basic information which will likely require that you use additional scholarly sources to flesh out this information.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1. Select a document from the assigned primary source readings (randomly is ok, but not preferable):
   1. If students wish to explore a specific topic not addressed in the assigned readings, non-assigned documents can be selected from the source readers folder posted in the Perusall library AS LONG AS THEY DEAL WITH SOME ASPECT OF MEDIEVAL RELIGION. If using a non-assigned primary source, you must receive approval from the professor a week before exercise no. 1 is due (i.e. September 19th).&#x20;
   2. You may also compare two document extracts that seem to be complementary/ in opposition and you think the juxtaposition of the two documents will be revealing something historically important. Be aware that since you will be trying to describe two documents your paper will likely need to be more than the minimum word count, so that you have enough space to describe the basics for two texts and account for differences. But a comparative approach can be fruitful.&#x20;
   3. If you want suggestions of what document to work on or wish to use a non-assigned source, you must discuss options with the professor (make an appointment to meet with him one-on-one).&#x20;
   4. Students have a tendency to imagine that shorter documents are easier to work on for this project. This is rarely the case, as  short documents require a lot of outside reading to make sense and when you get to the final stage (no. 3) shorter texts do not have much material for you to draw on to make an argument supported by evidence from the primary source.&#x20;
   5. The longest assigned texts are the texts associated with Peter Abelard, which are complicated but rich in details.&#x20;
2. Read the document(s). An initial reading will allow you to discover what kinds of ideas are present in the document. Print out a paper copy so that you can mark it up further or add nuanced annotations to the document on Perusall.
3. Make notes about terminology you wish to clarify or need help with. Terms which seem to relate to a key theme (which you identity) should be noted and later defined (annotations can link to definitions from the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/?tl=true), or such secondary sources as articles on JStor).&#x20;
4. Identify the fundamentals. This information might need to come from within the text, from the brief preface that might appear with it, or requires further reading from scholarly sources. In preparation, you will need to answer:
   1. Reflect briefly on the historical context of the primary source. When was the document written? What period does it belong to? What events close in time might have an impact on its writing? In general, what were major political, social, economic, or intellectual currents of the time period?
      1. If Augustine wrote his _City of God_ (an excerpt of which we read in week 3) before 410, why is that date significant? What does this timing help us understand or help us make conclusions about
   2. Who wrote it? And who were they? Reflect on the author of the primary source: Who produced this primary source? What was the author’s place in society (profession, status, class, gender, ethnicity, etc)? How might these factors influence the author’s point of view in the document? How would you characterize the author’s perspective?
      1. If anonymous, what can we tell about the author(s)?)
      2. Can we understand something about the author from the content of the document or must you depend on secondary literature. Use scholarly descriptions (secondary or tertiary sources to support your description of the author)?
   3. Where was it written? Where did it circulate (is this different)?
      1. "Where" can be a specific place or something wider. Was it limited to one monastery in southern France, or did it circulate around the Mediterranean?&#x20;
   4. Reflect on the audience of the primary source. What was the intended audience for this primary source? How might considerations about the intended audience shape the content and form offered in this source? Do we know this from clues inside the text or from a history of its circulation.&#x20;
      1. Books of the Bible, for example have a long life - circulating first in Hebrew, in Greek, later in Latin... and thus the audience changes.
5. Answering the above questions will help you understand the historical (religious/intellectual) context.&#x20;
   1. (Re)Read the optional secondary sources for the week corresponding to your primary source or reread your class notes (if we have already covered the primary source) to understand the time during which the text was written.&#x20;
   2. The best papers will consult additional articles or monographs which deal with the subject matter you have chosen to consider.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your paper will describe the historical context of the document you have chosen to study. But it will also have an argumentative element. It will argue about what time period/context the document has something to say.&#x20;

The Apostle's Creed read in the second week of class can be used by historians to describe the institutionalization of the Imperial Church (i.e. evidence of how the Council of Nicaea defined orthodox belief in light of the Arian heresy). But the version of the Apostle's Creed we read is an early modern translation. Thus the document could potentially speak to either context.

## Project Contents

Your written work will contain (something roughly resembling) the following:&#x20;

1. **Title Page**: Please include your name, student number, the course title and code, the name of your professor, and a title for your paper which addresses your particular topic and conclusion. Do not use “Document Analysis”, "Exercise no. 1" or the title of the document that you are studying as your title. Your title should reveal something about your approach to the text.&#x20;
2. **Introduction**. Your paper should begin with a brief introduction which summarizes the historical context of the document you are analyzing.&#x20;
   1. Most often the extracts are from longer documents. Make sure that if this is the case for your chosen source, that you name the title. The selection you read in week 3 by Augustine condemning the Jews, for example, comes from his book _The City of God_.
   2. The first time you reference the document, you need to provide a complete footnoted citation of the document. If the document is a single page you do not need to cite it again. If the document is lengthy, use parenthetical page numbers to cite additional references to the document.&#x20;
   3. For citations of other works, continue to use footnotes.&#x20;
3. **Paragraph 1: Authorship**. Tell me about the author, what else they wrote, why they are important historically. If the text is written anonymously, try to answer the same questions as far as scholars have been able to reconstruct them.&#x20;
4. **Paragraph 2: Dating**. Tell me when the document was written or different period in which it was important.&#x20;
   1. If you were to compare the Hebrew Genesis with the Old English Genesis, for example, you would note that Genesis is read at alot of different times (well, pretty much consistently from the time of its writing up to the present). Answer in what time period you think it is more usefully categorized for historians.&#x20;
   2. You can be creative to answer this. If you want to think about how Maimonides (12th century Jewish exegete) read Genesis, read and talk in this section about how patterns of Jewish scriptural interpretation changed in the 12th century CE (this will require a bit more reading).&#x20;
5. **Paragraph 3: Place of authorship and circulation**. This is useful to think about where the ideas come from and where they spread to. As historians, these are key things to know since they allow us to consider the transmission of ideas, but also to make conclusions about the influence of ideas in different places and at different times.&#x20;
6. **Paragraph 4: Audience**. This paragraph is linked to the last. You need to guess who is reading this document. Sometime evidence comes from the text itself (i.e. a letter has a recipient, or Agobard of Lyon's anti-judaic polemic is written to his King). Sometimes the named audience (Agobard's king) might be an "fictive" audience, and his audience might be other clerics or nobles? You may need to do extra research to fully get a sense of this answer.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarize your discussion and explain how understanding the context will help with your future analysis of a historical topic with it. In essence your conclusion should tell the reader how in your next assignment you will describe what the document is about (naming topic X), and why we should care (it tells us something important \[specify] about topic X).&#x20;
8. **Bibliography**: On a separate final page(s), you should have a bibliography citing all the works you have used.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need to show, not just state, your evidence. Don't just give a number for the date something was written, but show how this dating was arrived at or explain how the dating might be important for how historians want to use the document. Thinking who the author is (not just naming them) allows you to think of how this document fits in with their larger aims in life or other works of scholarship. I am not looking for you to tell me the answer as quickly as possible but rather for you to show me the evidence (from the document and from secondary sources) to back up your explanation of the sources' fundamentals.&#x20;
