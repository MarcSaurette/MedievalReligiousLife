# Exercise no. 2

## Document Description

_500 words of revised ex. 1 + 750 words of new text_

{% hint style="info" %}
The rewritten document analysis should incorporate the feedback offered by your  professor as well as demonstrate further research. Your rewritten document analysis should also further demonstrate your familiarity with key secondary sources on the topic you are writing.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This exercise asks you to build on your previous exercise, using your past work (revised) to describe the content of the primary source under your analysis.&#x20;

* In the [previous exercise](exercise-no.-1.md) (no. 1), you have determined the fundamentals of your primary source under analysis - noting essentially the context in which it is created. Knowing the author, the time period, the audience all help you start to think about _a priori_ assumptions you can start  subsequent analysis from. Knowing that Augustine is a bishop for example gives you ideas about how his text might be organized in specific ways and with specific goals that derive from his identity as a Christian leader.&#x20;
* In the [following exercise](exercise-no.-3.md) (no. 3), you will use the information you have gathered about fundamentals and content, to identify a clear argument you argue with evidence taken from the text answering **why** the text was written or why the text is significant to modern historians.&#x20;
* In this exercise (no. 2) you will explain to me what the text is and what it is about.&#x20;

### **Describe document**

Below are sets of new questions that you are to address in constructing your analysis. All of these questions are interrelated and will help shape your analysis, but not all need to be addressed in the paper. When writing the exercise, it is a good idea to figure out answers to as many questions as possible, but not necessarily include them in your paper if it is not relevant. When you figure out something you find super interesting (but not related to your discussion) you should put them into a footnote!

1. Identify what the document is that you are examining. It has a name, perhaps it has many names. Figure out what it is/they are. Note - that if you are dealing with a text in a source reader, they might give you a title that fits its purpose for the editor, but is not a name associated with the text itself. Sometimes, the editor offers the reader a modern name given to it. Sometimes they give you a title with is translated into English, sometimes not, sometimes it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet.&#x20;
   1. The _Estoria de España_ for example, is given a name by its editor as something like (translated) the _First general chronicle of Spain_. This is not what is author called it. This text also has various different versions. If possible, if your text has various versions figure out which one you're working on (this helps revise dating - because some versions will be writter earlier than others).&#x20;
2. Reflect on the form that your text takes.  What is genre of the text you are reading? Is it a letter? A chronicle or a history? A _vitae_ (i.e. sacred biography)? Poetry? How does its form affect how the audience might read it? Or how historians would believe it? Do some background reading on the genre your text falls into. Consider also:&#x20;
   1. Historians today tend to treat all historical genres as various claims to truth which present information in different ways to suit its audience and portray its authenticity. Thus all texts need to be interpreted to find what can be truthfully extracted from them. Law codes or memoirs are not somehow more truthful than saint's lives (unlike how 19th century medievalists often claimed). To explain further, an example:  the _Usatges of Barcelona_ do not necessary describe the historical reality of royal and vassal rights, but rather they might simply describe the relationship of prince and vassals that Ramon _wished_ to be seen as normal (a subtle but important difference)
   2. How does a familiar genre change between the Middle Ages and today? For example, we often think of _letters_ as a private genre (where people express innermost thoughts), whereas in the Middle Ages letters tend to be publicly circulated and thus are written without mentioning ideas that need to be kept private. Or thinking about a saint's life as more like a Hollywood version of history - it is more important to capture the feeling (the vibes?) than the reality, because the goal is not accuracy, but to produce feeling.&#x20;
3. If your source is an extract from a larger document. What is the rest of the document about? For example, if you are commenting on a section from Augustine's _City of God_, what does that work talk about overall.&#x20;
   1. If your sources is an extract, where does your extract fit in the original work (i.e. what place does hold in the overall text). Is it a small part of a larger argument or does it just sit chronologically in a larger text?
   2. If your source is an extract, does a longer or complete translation exist. Source readers often point the reader to the original translation in a footnote. Other sources are translated specifically for the source reader, so a longer translation of the whole document would not then be available.&#x20;
4. What language is the original document written in? If the original is not in English, who translated it and when, so that it could be made available to you. Are there versions of this text in different languages? Are there translations in another language that might be consultable by you (if you spoke French or Spanish).&#x20;
5. What is the document that you are focussing on about? If you are dealing with an entire long document, you are encouraged to describe an identifiable section - something that seems coherent to you (a chapter, a prologue etc.). The key to description is that it does not involve judgments or assumptions. You should just be repeating (albeit in a shorter more concisely worded form) the essence of the without quoting the original text and without providing assessment. Sometimes your description follows the flow of the text, but at other times (if there is repitition in the original) describe ideas thematically.&#x20;

## Project Contents

Your written work will resemble in many ways the first exercise with some more material added in.&#x20;

1. **Title Page**: Please include your name, student number, the course title and code, the name of your professor, and a title for your paper which addresses your particular topic and conclusion. Do not use “Document Analysis”, "Exercise no. 1" or the title of the document that you are studying as your title. Your title should reveal something about your approach to the text.&#x20;
2. **(Revised) Introduction**. Your paper should begin with a brief introduction which summarizes the historical context and nature of the document you are analyzing.&#x20;
   1. The first time you reference the document, you need to provide a complete footnoted citation of the document. If the document is a single page you do not need to cite it again. If the document is lengthy, use parenthetical page numbers to cite additional references to the document.&#x20;
   2. For citations of other works, continue to use footnotes.&#x20;
3. **(Mostly the same) Paragraph 2-4: Authorship, dating, circulation and audience.** This section repeats the work completed in exercise no. 1, likely condensed. Your previous assignment asked you to close with a conclusion telling the reader how context might shape the questions you ask of the document. The core of that conclusion should be present here incorporated into how you present the information (i.e. as an argument) not just a single sentence at the end. &#x20;
4. **(NEW) Paragraph 5. Document Genre**. Describe what form your document takes (i.e. what is its genre) and what are some of the features of this kind of genre.&#x20;
5. **(NEW) Paragraph 6. Description of the extract under analysis.** Your goal is to describe the contents of the specific passage you are looking at. You should explore how this section showcases the expected form for the genre.&#x20;
6. **(NEW) Paragraph 7. Themes.** What are the themes that the document presents - things like kingship, religious purity, gender, sexuality (etc.). Provide examples from the text of the themes. You do not need to interpret the meaning of the themes, just show that they exist with evidence.&#x20;
7. **(NEW) Paragraph 8. Areas of interest.** This is the section where you begin to speculate about potential areas that you want to pursue further in the future. What has caught your attention and make you want to research further (it is key this idea(s) could be feasibly argued with the evidence from the document itself)?
8. **(Revised) Paragraph 9. Conclusion.** Restate your findings and close with a nod to what you plan to study in the next assignment.&#x20;
9. **Bibliography**: On a separate final page(s), you should have a bibliography citing all the works you have used.
