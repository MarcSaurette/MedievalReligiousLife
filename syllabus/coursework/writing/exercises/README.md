# Exercises

Over the term, students will complete a series of short written exercises meant to cultivate an ability to read, understand and express the historical significance of primary sources.&#x20;

Students will write three distinct, but linked exercises, showing an ability to engage in critical historical thinking and research. Each exercise will build on the last, and the final exercise will culminate in a thorough analysis of a single historical document dealing with some aspect of medieval religion.&#x20;

* Students will be sorted into small groups to provide peer feedback on fellow studentsâ€™ work for the first two exercises.
* &#x20;The exercises are **cumulative** - meaning that the second exercise contains the text of the first exercise (revised in light of comments from the professor and peers), as well as new text to fulfill the next expectations. The third exercise contains the text of the first two exercises (revised and corrected) as well as new text.

The three stages are:&#x20;

1. Fundamentals  September 26th, 11:59pm
2. Description        October 17th, 11:59pm
3. Significance      November 28th, 11:59pm
