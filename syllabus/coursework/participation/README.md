# Participation

{% hint style="danger" %}
You will make a case for your participation mark in a Process Letter (via an online form) due on December 6th.  Students who do not complete the process letter will receive 0 on participation.&#x20;

Participation is very important for this class. One of our main learning objectives is to improve students’ ability to verbalize their thoughts and assesments, as well as logically discuss/ debate. Nothing can be evidence unless it is placed in a logical argument, and class is meant to let you practice this faculty.

Participation consists of being in class, asking questions, showing you've learned from doing the readings/ annotations, etc (an abbreviation of _et cetera_, Latin for "and other things"). But, let's get this out in the open – participation is always difficult to assess. I can measure what I see, but I don't know the work that has been done behind the scenes (especially if you are a quiet or shy student). So typically, I have had students assign themselves a mark for participation each class – based on a rubric assigning points for attendence and for degree of participation.

**I will take attendance** and at the end of the term, you will write up a [process letter](../writing/process-letters.md) explaining the quality of your participation, part of which will be to assess your contributions to class discussions and your reading record.

## Be Prepared <a href="#be-prepared" id="be-prepared"></a>

The most important part of participation is being prepared. You might be willing to contribute and be able to speak persuasively, but this intent does not contribute if you have not read and thought about the materials assigned for each class. You are asked to make annotations on the readings of the textbook each week. This will be an important part of your participation. You'll be asked to write a minimum of five (5) annotations each week on your [Readings](../readings.md).

## How to Participate <a href="#how-to-participate" id="how-to-participate"></a>

Our plan is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to actively participate in the course. In fact, students may actually have more ways to show participation in this online model. Students will be able to actively participate through the following :

* Annotation and commenting on Perusall.
  * Students are asked to read, comment on and reflect on the textbook readings (and additional assigned/optional texts) via Perusall.
* Q+A periods during lectures
  * Students will be encouraged to add questions/comments throughout lectures; during mid-lecture Q+A periods, the profs and TA’s will pick several questions/comments to discuss further/respond to
* Small group breakout sessions during class
  * During classes, students will be broken up into small breakout groups  to discuss a particular question/theme or documents, after which groups will be invited to report back to the full class.
* Discussions with prof during office hours

## General principles of evaluation:  <a href="#general-principles-of-evaluation" id="general-principles-of-evaluation"></a>

In general, here are some examples of the type of questions students will be asked to think about in evaluating their participation in their [process letters](../writing/process-letters.md):

* Were they present at class?
* Did the student remain strongly focused during the class and did s/he/they seek to actively listen/process/integrate the ideas during class discussions?
* Did the student participate in class discussion (e.g. through live questions/comments; through the chat/whiteboard functions)?
* Did the student demonstrate significant and insightful knowledge regarding class material (has s/he been able to consistently answer questions about the readings in class, pose thoughtful questions in/outside of class, demonstrated that s/he/they has attempted to connect the themes/ideas of class to the contemporary world, etc)?
* Did the student enhance the learning environment by participating respectfully in discussions with her/his colleagues?
