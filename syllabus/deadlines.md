## Late Penalties

Late assignments will be penalized at the rate of 5% per 24 hour period that the assignment is late. Thus, a late project due on Monday at 10am but handed in at Monday 11am or Tuesday 9 am will both be subject to the same late penalty deductions. Delays are cumulative, thus something 25 hours late = 2 x 24hr = 10% deduction. The professor may also choose to not accept some late assignments.

If you do have to hand something in late for a valid reason, please let me know (in advance) if there are good reasons for why you can't get something in one time, and we can try to find possible solutions (see below, [Extensions](deadlines.md#extensions-and-accommodations)). Also most things you are expected to submit are drafts - which will be edited again by yourself and others so things don't always need to be "perfect".&#x20;

## Extensions and Accommodations <a href="#extensions-and-accommodations" id="extensions-and-accommodations"></a>

As far as I am concerned, you do not need to give me (Marc Saurette) a doctor's note or a self-declaration form. You can just let me know if problems or illnesses have arisen and we can discuss timelines and strategies for you to complete your work. If you have been sick and this has delayed you from completing assignments, please let me know sooner rather than later so that we can work with you to come up with a new plan/ timeline. I understand that illness can mess up your intended work timeline, so the more information I know, the more I can help you plan.
