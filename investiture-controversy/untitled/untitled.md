# Dicing

At various times during our Investiture Controversy game, we will need to roll dice. I think the easiest solution for us all rolling dice together ... and apart ... is to use [https://rolldicewithfriends.com/](https://rolldicewithfriends.com/). If you have other solutions I am open to changing this...

One the rare occasions we need to use dice in the game, follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to [https://rolldicewithfriends.com/](https://rolldicewithfriends.com/) using a browser and join the room "Investiture Controversy"

2\. Click the button "Roll Dice with Friends" and you'll be brought to a semi-private room.

3\. in the top left corner of the window, you can (and should) change the default name to your character name, so we know who is rolling what.

4\. We roll dice as needed (in this game, the rolls are usually with six-sided dice).
