# Assessment

Midway through the course and at the end of the term, students will be asked to write a letters describing their "process"" of learning. They are critical self-evaluations (_critical_ in the sense of "using logic and evidence to argue"), describing your learning and how your work evolved over the year. It should be a reflection on your work, including links to examples of work you find most representative (even work that you don't otherwise turn in).

I will post a form on Teams for students to submit, but you may submit a long form written answer (an argument rather than answers to specific questions) if you prefer.

* The final end of year assessment will be a (600 word) reflection on your work this year
