# Writing

There is no easy way to describe the exact writing requirements of this course as it will vary from person to person, depending on the roles they embrace. Generally the writing requirements are as follows:&#x20;

1. In the first half of the term, students will be expected to write various texts (about 1,000 words in total) in support of game play. What each student will write will depend on the character they have been assigned and their specific goals. Usually these are preparations for speeches (a script) or texts intended to convince/ manipulate fellow game players.&#x20;
2. At the end of the game, students must write up a written evaluation of the game play. The goal is to highlight the best and worst parts of the game. This is intended to act as inspiration for the game design part of the course.&#x20;

Then we have a choice. At the beginning of March, we could potentially play another RTTP game if you feel it is a good learning format. In this case, the writing requirements will be roughly the same as if the first part of the term.  The other option is that we move from Game play to Game Design. This would allow us to potentially explore an area of medieval history raised in the readings from first term... topic TBD (well, chosen from a list of potential topics we brainstorm together).&#x20;

If we choose the second option:&#x20;

1. In the second part of the course, students would work creating a draft of a historically-informed role-playing game (along the lines of the [Reacting to the Past](https://reacting.barnard.edu/) for those who may have played them in other classes). The focus of the game will be an area that we will research and explore together as a class. &#x20;
2. Our goal will be to convert our research and hypotheses about medieval life into a playable pedagogical-style game. We will work together to brainstorm ideas, research history, plan out scenarios, and write up a rulebook. Students will write short biographies of key persons, identify and introduce (translated) primary and secondary sources which will be key to tell the story, figure out how one “wins” and the such. Students will thus work independently on different aspects of a class project that will build one big thing at the end.
3. Historians attempt to take very complex historical situations and view them through different interpretive lenses. They see "rules" to how history works. In creating a game, we will seek to identify key defining features of the medieval past and distill them into game mechanics.

No one is expected to have any experience in game-design, but rather we will work together to accomplish our work. It is the process, far more than the product, which is important for our learning.

The game will have successive stages after the first part of the course has ended:

1. **Preparatory reading**. Students will orient themselves to the literature on the the chosen topic (TBD), game design etc. as presented on Perusall.&#x20;
2. **Initial Brainstorming.** early March, 2021. In a series of meetings after Reading Week, students undertake a post-game evaluation to identify what worked and didn't in the _Investiture Controversy_ game. This will be an initial mechanism to hash out what the game may look like.
3. **Research and Writing phase.** March 2021. Students will continue research into their particular subject area, identify possible game dynamics and report back (or request) further explanation from the professor. Students will annotate readings on Perusall and produce an common annotated bibliography as the basis of their developing project. We will likely meet synchronously only one class per week to get updates on everyone's work.&#x20;
4. **Game Creation**. April 2021. Students will work together to write a rulebook, design accompanying artwork and produce a prototype. Students will be responsible for creating a draft version.
5. **Game Release**. End of Term 2021. At the end of the school year, students will release a version (even if unfinished) for others to critique and enjoy.

In light of the class being taught as distance-learning and as a result of the nature of the coursework, I will be using a hybrid form of “ungrading” in which assessment will draw heavily of students’ self- assessment of their participation, work and contributions. On the topic of “ungrading” see [the work of Jesse Strommel](https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-an-faq/).&#x20;
