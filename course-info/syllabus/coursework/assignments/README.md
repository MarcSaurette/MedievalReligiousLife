# Exercises

### Learning Together

Each week, we officially have 3hrs of assigned class time, divided into two time slots of 1 1/2 hrs each, on Mondays & Wednesdays from 13h00 to 14h30. Generally, on Mondays, I will introduce the topic for that week, provide some background and then typically we will discuss the readings and questions raised by the students in advance (via annotation). On Wednesdays, we may continue our discussion if there are a few unanswered questions andusually will work through a problem or exercise.&#x20;

I will provide some explanation and an initial introduction to the exercise on Wednesdays, but much of the work may need to be completed on the students own time. Students will be expected to complete a certain number of annotations, lines of translation and ths such. Usually feedback will be given via Perusall or Hypothes.is .

Examples of the kinds of classroom exercises we will do:

* annotate a primary source and its antiquated English in something more modern
* annotate a scholarly article together - using [Perusall](../../../digital-tools/perusall.md) or [hypothes.is](../../../digital-tools/hypothes.is.md) to understand its structure and purpose (in order to teach how to read secondar sources)&#x20;
* transcribe the 11th century handwritten copy of an 8th century letter

In the detailed outline for each week, I will post links to detailed instructions of the pertinent exercise.
