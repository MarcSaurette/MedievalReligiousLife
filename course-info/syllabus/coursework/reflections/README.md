# Writing

In the first term, the students will be expected to write short pieces each week to practice using evidence to make a point, to reflect on your learning and to explore topics raised in class. The key to academic success is practice â€“ especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when a genre is unfamiliar or the expectations are unclear.&#x20;

I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you. Above all I just want you to get used to writing without worrying to much about being perfect at it. Many weeks you will need to write a "reflection". This is a catch-all term given to writing assignments that ask you to "reflect" on (or think about or meditate on) the learning you accomplished that week.&#x20;

At the beginning of the year, I will distribute a list of topics intended to help you focus your writing (which you get to choose from). I am suggesting you to write these reflections not as you, the Carleton student, but as your character attending "The Academy". They can be as creative as you choose: a letter home, an entry from your diary, a page of notes from your Academy classes, a photo of your recreated "dorm room" bulletin board... They can also be very typically academic writing if you prefer.&#x20;

The initial topics will be:&#x20;

1. [Self Profile](profile.md)
2. [Character Profile](character-profile.md)
3. [What do I think about the Middle Ages?](what-do-i-think-about-the-middle-ages.md)

After the initial weeks you will have more leeway in choosing what specifically you wish to write about.&#x20;
