# Small Group Discussions

During synchronous time online, students will sometimes be asked to divide up into small Teams meetings with their group members. People will be assigned to groups randomly.

1. When you are asked to join your groups, you will need to navigate in Teams to the channel of your assigned house.
2. I or another student will initiate a meeting in the channel by pressing the "Meeting" button in the top right corner of the window, which everyone (in that channel) can (and should) join.&#x20;

3\. You can jump between your House meeting and the class meeting by clicking on the camera icon of your choice (General vs. House) in the list of channels on the lefthand side of the window.&#x20;

You can type posts on the channel  or speak on camera during these group sessions. Usually you'll be asked to think about a specific question together or accomplish another goal (such as write a short text, or annotate a paragraph together).
