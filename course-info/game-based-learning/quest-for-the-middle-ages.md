# Quest for the Middle Ages

In the first term of the seminar, students will "Quest for the Middle Ages" â€“ i.e. engage in a co-operate pedagogical game intended to orient you to the university and develop your skills as a historian.&#x20;

In the game you will:

* develop an avatar of yourself as a new Acolyte of the Medievalist Arts
* work together with other students to complete a digital scavenger hunt and unlock the mystery of "The Academy"
* use your creativity to develop our understanding of the Academy and the events happening there
* practice the analytical skills of a historian/ medievalist by evaluating evidence and testimonies for inconsistencies, silences, contradictions and proof of what is happening at "the Academy".

As part of the game, you can complete optional "side-quests" (supplemental skills building and the such) to earn experience points.&#x20;
