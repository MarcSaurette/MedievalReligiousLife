### Goals for this week (September 9, 2020)

By the end of the first week (by Sunday, September 13th), what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

1. You'll get to know a bit about your professor and your fellow classmates
2. You will know what the course is all about and how we're going to run it
3. You will figure out how to use some tools necessary for learning online
4. You will be introduced to the game, _Quest for the Middle Ages_ by reading the Orientation guide (in Perusall and also posted in Teams).&#x20;

### Overview:

The first week of class provides a transition back to school. This year the transition back to school also corresponds to a transition to online learning. This week asks you to focus on practical concerns, especially on getting used to the online environment we will be using in this class. Normally the first class of the year focusses on handing out/ discussing the syllabus and getting to know one another. So we're doing that this year. This week I want you to:&#x20;

1. Make sure you can access your Carleton email (ends in a @cmail.carleton.ca)
2. Read the syllabus and schedule on Gitbook (i.e. this place).&#x20;
3. Use [MS Teams](../course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) (activate, install and login to the class group).&#x20;
4. Login to[ Perusall](../course-info/digital-tools/perusall.md) and start annotating your first reading assignments.&#x20;
5. Read up about the[ Digital tools ](../course-info/digital-tools/)we'll be using this year.
6. [Introduce yourself and say hello](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/assignments/1.-introduce-yourself.md) to your classmates in the week one channel on Teams.
7. Complete this [background survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=lRjZagbeXki8UfzhJsyFMHYe4bjIkPJLpePMoYTjyCNUREFQWEtNU0QwRlc2VDRYWTFLOEhCV01aSS4u) to let me know more about you.&#x20;

### **Online Time**

This week we will not have any dedicated synchronous online time in order to give everyone time to download and install Teams, which we will be using to meet up online for the class. You need ensure that you have Teams installed on your computer and working so that you can join our class in week 2's online time.

During class time in the first week (**13h00-2h30, Wednesday September 9, 2020**), I will be online, checking email and on Teams. I'll be available to help (as much as I can) if you have any connection issues or any questions that arise from your reading the syllabus.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

1\. Read the syllabus section of this course guide and also the sections on Digital Tools.&#x20;

2\. Once you have logged-in to [Perusall](../course-info/digital-tools/perusall.md), you will find a copy of Marc Bloch's _The Historian's Craft_. Please read the introduction, and test out the annotation function it to emphasize key ideas, or ask questions of things which don't make sense.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We are going to read the entirety of Marc Bloch's book over the first part of the term to give us a sense of how the discipline of History has been defined. Each week you will have a reading and annotation assignments so that you get through the whole of the book by the week 6 class, when we will be discussing it and you will have to write a written response to the book.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

3\. As preparation for week 2, please read and annotate Zachary A. Strietelmeier, "Remembering the Middle Ages".

4\. You will also find an orientation guide to our pedagogical game, _Quest for the Middle Ages_ on Perusall. If you wish, annotate things you find interesting or confusing.&#x20;
